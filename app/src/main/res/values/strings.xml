    <string name="intro_fsmc">The following questionnaire is about problems in everyday life which are directly associated with an extreme form of tiredness (fatigue). This extreme form of tiredness refers to an overwhelming state of lethargy, exhaustion and lack of energy which comes on abruptly and is unrelated to any obvious external causes. It does not mean the sort of isolated episodes which everyone might experience in the course of the day, after exertion, or after a sleepless night! \n\n Please read each statement carefully. Then decide to what extent each statement applies to you and your everyday life. Please try not to base your answers on the way you are feeling at the moment; instead try to give us a picture of the way you feel in normal day-to-day life. Please put a cross in the appropriate circle (only one cross per statement please!).</string>
    <string name="summary_text">You have completed all the screening measures.\n \n
        If you are interested in sharing more details about your health situation with us, there are some optional, more detailed questionnaires coming up next.</string>
